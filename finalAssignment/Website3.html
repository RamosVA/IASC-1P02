  <p>The Ramoid army</p>
</div>
<p id="suprise3">A Ramoid army is a bit more of my competitive and prideful side. is someone who is trying to get a following online, I felt like a name for my fan base was necessary. despite probably never getting one. I went with Ramoid because a friend of mine once called me that as a joke, however, I enjoyed the sound of it and decided to keep it. Although I tend to keep things humble when discussing myself I believe that there is always going to be a competitive side to me that always tries to be the best form that they can be. I felt like the Ramoid army was a good choice given the theme that I have chosen for all three websites. I'm constantly trying to better myself and be the best version that I can be. whether it be as a person or in my actual art. With that comes the Instinct of constantly evolving. The Ramoid Army to me is this ideology or mentality of no matter what I do online or in person there are going to be people that might look up to me. whether or not it's true, and it just may not be. there's always a sense of having to carry yourself a specific way. And with that not only being humble is important, but showcasing that you can celebrate your victories is as well. I'm by no means an influencer or someone with any standings and society. But having a goal is always important, and at the moment even if it was the smallest glimpse of that would be sufficient for me. So this aspect of the website is to demonstrate ambition. that once they understand your story, and resonate with that, they may just decide to see where your life is headed and support you. which I feel brings everything  Full Circle when looking at the three websites. The image that you would see at the bottom is what I would depict as a Ramoid.  The image itself is a joke that someone made for me, of Bingley, however his face was swapped for a Pokemon's face. Even though it was made for a joke, I enjoyed how it looked and decided to keep the design. I think the overall tone of my presence online is I want to provide someone with a pleasant feeling. so a lot of my work especially when drawing characters and such the neutral facial expression that I typically go with is a slight smile. and I just feel like those who are willing to count themselves are Ramoids, are people who enjoy having Pleasant experiences, a wide smile is only fitting. and the fact that they still look like being like I view it as we're not too different. people can be more like than they may give themselves credit for and an army of just smiling ghosts that all look the same is sort of symbolic of that.  At the end of the day, all three websites are just concepts that I've created and don't hold much weight in the real world. However, all three of these things are sentimental to me. It was only fitting for me to create websites that I felt proud of.
