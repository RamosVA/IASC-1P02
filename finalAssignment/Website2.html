  <h1>Ramos</h1>

  <p>The man behind Bingley</p>
  </div>

  <p id="text"> My name is Jonathan Ramos, however, my friends call me “Ramos”.  I'm someone who is looking to be a virtual artist and has created an online personality that I like to use instead of having to show my actual face. I'm what you would call an introverted social butterfly. I'm rarely looking for a prolonged interaction with someone, however, I do feel like if I am in one,  I get some of the social Rush that Social Butterflies would get in that scenario. The character that you see at the bottom is known as “Ramos.” As someone who is not always as comfortable being in the eye of attention, I've created some characters to sort of portray myself. These characters are completely fictional and for the most part, they're just for creative social events. I didn't base the character's design on how I look, it's more of a humanoid Bingley In a bit of an anime style. I don't claim that the character is the real form of me because I know that the character is simply just a gimmick that I do. however  I always found it easier to be something that I am not versus being myself. Not in the sense that, I can't be genuine, more, it comes more naturally to play a character. I'm trying to be more of a virtual artist, whether it be doing digital work or art.  Therefore, much like how Bingley is my mascot, Ramos is my standard for myself when sometimes it's difficult to showcase the real me. In terms of the art that I like to do, it's more of a mixture of different things. I don't take myself very seriously, I'm a Relaxed and easygoing person, and I feel like especially with a character that isn't myself I find it easier to just poke fun at things at what I'm doing. A lot of my early work was just abstract art because I like the aesthetic of just interpretation versus intent in art. However I  transitioned into drawing characters and specific styles. Although I'm still trying to create my unique style I feel like in my most recent drawings it's been more cheerful and in my own opinion sharper than it used to be. That's occasionally streamed from time to time, and I always use  Bingley, or Ramos as my digital avatar, because I always feel more comfortable using a digital Avatar over having to show my face. It has nothing to do with immersing myself in a digital world, it's more of just insecurities about myself and wanting to have confidence online. A lot of the assets I use in most of the projects that I do are made by me. Which can be very time-consuming. Most people would try Outsourcing or getting the needed properties online. however, I have always had the ideology of doing things yourself. As difficult as it may be, being 100% genuine to who you are is very important. Even if the product doesn't look as professional as others, I always felt a sense of Pride because, regardless, I created that project. As mentioned before, when being told that I had free reins on these three websites that I would be designing, I decided to have it as an extension of myself because I always felt like being able to control what I do should be a standard in my own life. if I divided it into three separate parts of myself. Ramos is more of the closest that you're going to get to the actual artist behind what I do.  </p>
