<p id="suprise"> Bingley is a ghost that was created by the artist Ramos.   He's an original character that I have created to be a mascot. He's one of the first original characters I ever made and for obvious reasons, holds a special place in my heart. When designing a website I decided to make it an extension of myself over three pages and I decided how one would do that. then realizing that Bingley was the perfect candidate to be one of the main themes of the websites. Although his design is a little simplistic, I always enjoyed that one of our drawings. characters didn't need to be overly detailed to be memorable and I feel like his simplistic design and somewhat Stand Out outfit was enough for Bingley to be a memorable mascot. Creating Bingley was an interesting process. It took multiple attempts to come up with a  mascot design for myself, wanting to do professional work online whether it be streaming or being a digital artist. I always felt that mascots were a good idea to have to just be a stand-in for when you may feel too shy to showcase your self. One day I just started doodling the shape of a ghost, and I gave him a silly little hat with a little string on the end. I had no intention of making a ghost a mascot, however, I enjoyed his look so much that I decided to stick with it. I like the fact that I have to waste time doodling legs and just a nice little tail. Bingley went through many different design changes,  at one point he had pupils, and at another design, he had a completely different color scheme. However I kept changing and adding little things to Bingley, and I realized that the main point that I was trying to convey was that I wanted a friendly-looking mascot. one that didn't come off as aggressive or threatening. The color scheme I went with for Bingley,  stemmed from the fact that I wanted the colors to be aesthetically pleasing. when I decided first and foremost that I wanted to have to be blue, I immediately decided the eye color to be a frozen teal. and with each little decision I made in terms of color the more I wanted them to be matching if broken down into solely colors, the colors would look pleasing to the eye and if thrown onto the wall it wouldn't look bad. After creating the color scheme and the general design of being late it came down to finally putting it on a drawing canvas and sketching them out. I used to Doodle sometimes in school or class, however, I didn't think that I was going to randomly design my mascot one day. I  bought myself a drawing tablet and taught myself how to draw regular sketches, and then to line art. After I felt confident in these steps I drew my first iterations. Finally, after a lot of trial and error in trying to get the perfect lines learning shortcuts on different applications, I was able to sketch out my rendition of Bingley the ghost.  </p>
