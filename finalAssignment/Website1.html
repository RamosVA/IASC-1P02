<p id="suprise">Bingley is a ghost that was created by the artist Ramos.   He's an original character that I have created for the purpose of being a mascot. He's one of the first original characters I ever made and for obvious reason, holds a special place in my heart. When designing a website I decided to make it an extension of myself over three pages and I decided how I would like to do that. I realized that Bingley was the perfect candidate to be one of the main themes of the websites. Although his design is a little simplistic, I always enjoyed didn't need to be overly detailed to be memorable and I feel like his simplistic design and somewhat unique outfit was enough for Bingley to be a memorable mascot. Creating Bingley was an interesting process. It took multiple attempts to come up with a  mascot design for myself, wanting to do professional work online whether it be streaming or being a digital artist. I always felt that mascots were always a good idea to have to just be a stand-in for when you may feel shy to showcase your own self. One day I just started doodling the shape of a ghost, and I gave him a silly little hat with a little string on the end. I had no intention of making a ghost a mascot, however I enjoyed his look so much that I decided to stick with it. I like the fact that I don't need to waste time doodling legs and just a nice little tail. Bingley went through many different design changes, at one point he had pupils, and on another design he had a completely different color scheme. However, while I kept changing and adding little things to Bingley, I realized that the main point that I was trying to convey is that I wanted a friendly looking mascot. I wanted a mascot that didn't come off as aggressive or threatening. The color scheme I went with for Bingley,  stemmed with the fact that I wanted the colors to be aesthetically pleasing. When I decided first and foremost that I wanted to have to be blue, I immediately decided the eye color to be a frozen teal. With each little decision I made in terms of color, the more I wanted them to be matching and if broken down into solely colors, the colors would look pleasing to the eye.After creating the color scheme and the general design of being late it came down to finally putting it on a drawing canvas and sketching him out. I used to doodle sometimes in school or in class, however I didn't think that I was going to randomly design my own mascot one day. I  bought myself a drawing tablet, and taught myself how to draw regular sketches, then to line art. After I felt confident in these steps I drew my first iterations. Finally after a lot of trial and error of trying to get the perfect lines learning shortcuts on different applications, I was able to sketch out my rendition of Bingley the ghost.   </p>
